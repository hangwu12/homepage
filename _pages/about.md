<b>ABOUT</b>
<br>

Hello! Welcome to this space!

I am a PhD candidate in the joint program of Cinema and Media Studies and East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. My research explores Chinese media history and theory in the eras of broadcasting, digital, and new media. Focusing on the televisual mediations of cinema, serial novels, manhua, animation, and video games, my dissertation traces the genealogical history of media convergence and transmedia world-building in the Chinese context, from Hong Kong broadcast television to mainland digital platform web series.
