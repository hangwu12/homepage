I developed this <a href="https://simondon.uc.r.appspot.com/">web search application</a> for our Simondon reading group. We have been gathering together on a weekly basis to read and discuss Simondon's newly translated book <i>Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information</i> since 2020 fall. It is an amazing experience to read something in detail, especially for a book as such that often feels impossible and impenetrable to read on one's own. As we often tried to make sense of what Simondon means by certain concepts, or how does one notion can be related to another notion in his terms, I had the idea of building up a web search engine that is capable of locating keywords and returning passages that are the most relevant. 

It is a python-based application built with Flask and Whoosh, and hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, almost for free (it charges me approximately 0.1 cents per month!). 

For copyright reasons, it requires users to log in to use the searching function and is not open for registration.

I personally find it very helpful!
