### **Memex**
#### Memex mimics the way that the human mind operates. Its principle is association. There are "some intricate web of trails" that the mind follows. Information is not ordered alphabetically or numerically, but organized by the associative way of thinking and feeling. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. (43)

A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. (43)

#### it leaves a trial
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. (44)

items also join together

Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails. (45)

#### **Communication as electrical vibrations**
##### #+BEGIN_QUOTE
We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the **electrical vibrations** which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can **pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene** which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.
The impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist (45) convey her fingers the translated information which reach- es her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?
